# Contributing to NegPy

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **NegPy**!

## 🛠️ Development Setup

NegPy requires **Python 3.13+**. We use **uv** for environment and dependency management.

### 1. Prerequisites
Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) if you haven't already.

**Scanner support (optional):** NegPy's direct scanner integration uses SANE (libsane).

- **Linux** (Debian/Ubuntu):
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S sane  # arch
  sudo apt install libsane-dev  # debian/ubuntu
  ```

- **macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install sane-backends
  ```

- **Windows**: 
Scanner support is not yet available on windows.


### 2. Python Environment
The `Makefile` handles synchronization via `uv`. Run this to set up your environment:

```bash
make install
```


### 3. Running Locally

```bash
make run
```

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The codebase follows a modular architecture:

- `negpy/domain/`: Core data models, types, and interfaces.
- `negpy/features/`: Image processing logic implementations (Exposure, Geometry, Lab, etc.).
- `negpy/infrastructure/`: Low-level system implementations (GPU resources, file loaders).
- `negpy/kernel/`: Core system services (Logging, Config, caching).
- `negpy/services/`: High-level orchestration (Rendering engine, Export service).
- `negpy/desktop/`: PyQt6 UI implementation (View, Controller, Workers).
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.

## 📐 Coding Standards

**Always run `make format` before committing.**

### 1. Style & Formatting
- **Ruff**: Used for both linting and formatting.
- **Type Hints**: Required for all new function definitions (`ty` is enforced). Using `cast` to get around it is frowned upon.
- **Docstrings**: Use clear, concise docstrings for classes and public methods.
- **Style**: Use double quotes for strings, snake_case for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes.

### 2. Testing
We use `pytest`. New features should include unit tests in the `tests/` directory.

```bash
make test
```

`make test` skips tests marked `slow` by default (see `addopts` in `pyproject.toml`). This includes the performance metrics suite in `tests/metrics/`.

To run the metrics tests locally, point `NEGPY_PERF_RAW` at a Fujifilm X70 RAF file and run:

```bash
NEGPY_PERF_RAW=/path/to/DSCF1276.RAF \
NEGPY_METRICS_OUT=metrics-artifacts/preview_metrics.json \
uv run pytest tests/metrics/ -m "slow" -q
```

If `NEGPY_PERF_RAW` is not set the suite will attempt to download the fixture to `~/.cache/negpy-metrics/` automatically, or skip if the download fails.

### 3. Workflow (The Makefile)
The `Makefile` is the central source of truth for developer commands and executes everything via `uv run`:
- `make install`: Set up environment and sync dependencies.
- `make lint`: Run Ruff checks.
- `make type`: Run `ty` type checks.
- `make test`: Run all unit tests.
- `make format`: Auto-format code with Ruff.
- `make all`: Run lint, type, and test in sequence.
- `make clean`: Removes cache and build artifacts.


## 📦 Building and Packaging

To build the standalone application for your current OS:

```bash
make build
```
This will trigger the Python backend build via PyInstaller.
